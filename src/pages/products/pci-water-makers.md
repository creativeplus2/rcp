The Neptune+ OG line is our newest development in the Neptune Series of Watermakers. The rugged design addresses the demanding needs of the Oil and Gas industry, Rental Fleets, Isolated Island applications, or anywhere environmental conditions require solid engineering and troublefree operation. Building on the foundation and excellent track record of the Neptune+APC, we’ve increased filtration, added FRP cluster housings and direct drive pumps. The frame with built-in lifting eyes comes in 316 Stainless Steel or 6061 Aluminum. Our Exclusive V4 HMI/PLC Control System is fully automated and customizable through a marine certified, high-resolution Touch Screen. Enclosures are completely NMEA 4X compliant, and explosion proof ratings are also available. Couple this unit with its corresponding media filtration skid, and you’ll have the optimal system.<br /><br /><br /><br />
