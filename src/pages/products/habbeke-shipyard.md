Habbeké Shipyard, established in 1966, has more than fifty years experience of quality shipbuilding. The wharf builds exclusively in aluminium, and enjoys an excellent reputation for innovation, quality and service. These characteristics were recognised and honoured when Habbeké was awarded the Dutch Aluminium Prize in 1994.

One of the key factors in the yard’s success is its commitment to working with the client and the designer. This has resulted in many long-term relationships with individual and institutional customers. Some individuals have ordered three vessels from the yard but the longest association is with KNRM (The Royal Dutch Lifeboat Association).<br /><br /><br /><br />
