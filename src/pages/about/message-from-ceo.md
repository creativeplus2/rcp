**For more than two decades, PT Rahayu Carita Perkasa (RCP) has served the nation. Among other services, we specialize in the service, repair, refurbishment and up-grading of lifeboats for ships, rigs and offshore oil & gas platforms.**

As a contribution to our nation, we currently train local people to be in prominent roles, replacing the need for expatriates. We are committed to increasing our local workforce. We are constantly upgrading our quality management by focusing on safety, health and environment. We also apply ISO certifications and good corporate governance to support our service to customers.

Our endeavors have resulted in an endorsement from the Ministry of Transportation. RCP is the first company to receive an endorsement of this type from the Directorate General of Sea
Transportation, Ministry of Transportation.

This achievement is a testament that striving for excellence and focusing on ensuring total customer satisfaction is our main goal. We firmly believe that the growth we seek will be achieved through our loyal customers.
